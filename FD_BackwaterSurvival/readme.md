# Backwater Frontier Defense Survival addon

## Description

This addon implements a few changes on Backwater for Frontier Defense:
- **Harvester position modified to make it harder**
- **Custom wave: play this One-Wave gamemode and try to survive!**

This addon uses Insane Frontier defense too --> Those files are added to this mod to keep it simple. It includes:

Yes, it is like Titanfall 2 Insane Difficulty!
- **No minimap!**
- **No retries: you only have one chance**
- **Smarter AI**

But we pushed it a little further
- **Harvester modified: 33% less health and 50% less shield!** 
- **Smart pistol banned**
- **Titan build is not that easy**
- **Titans spawn with no shield** // this also affects enemy titans so it isn't thaaat bad, doesn't it?

A little brief of what "Smarter AI" means
- **Overall aim improvement (like crazy)**
- **Grunts can use more weapons now**
- **Titans can now use not only tactical but also their artillery!**
- **Titans can now spawn with burn cards for their weapons!** 
- **Be careful with suicide spectres**
- **Hope you don't find arc titans as a pilot**
- **Nuke titans are a little bit faster**
