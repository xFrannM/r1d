# Scavenger Rebalance Addon

You can launch this gamemode through Console only (set the keybind on in-game keyboard settings if not assigned yet)

There are two ways to launch:
ON RECOMMENDED MAPS: launchplaylist at; mp_gamemode scv
ON YOUR DESIRED MAP: launchplaylist at; mp_gamemode scv; map mp_MAP
(being mp_MAP the map you want to play)
you can see all the maps if you write in console "map mp" and take a look at the autocomplete (you can move through the options with arrow keys)

## Description

This addon aims to balance Scavenger cut gamemode:

- **Amount of minerals lowered** // there were a lot so this will make the game more tactical
- **Slow down mineral spawn speed**
- **Exclude some unplayable maps** // on some maps the minerals spawn is fucked up
