# Titan Tag Rebalance Addon

You can launch this gamemode through Console only (set the keybind on in-game keyboard settings if not assigned yet)

There are two ways to launch:
ON A RANDOM MAP: launchplaylist ps; mp_gamemode ctfp
ON YOUR DESIRED MAP: launchplaylist ps; mp_gamemode ctfp; map mp_MAP
(being mp_MAP the map you want to play)
you can see all the maps if you write in console "map mp" and take a look at the autocomplete (you can move through the options with arrow keys)

IMPORTANT: if you change any Match Setting on the lobby, it might reactivate titans for everyone which is not expected to be a thing on this gamemode (it does not break it but it is not the point to let anyone have a titan)

## Description

This addon aims to balance Titan Tag cut gamemode:

- **Change pilot kill score from 4 to 1** // shit was ending too fast and was too proplayer-sided
- **No AI on the game** // you were able to win points when killing AI before
